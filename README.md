### The Hautbois Project

The "**H**ybrid **a**nd **U**niversal **T**ext-**B**ased **O**rchestral **I**nstruments **S**imulator" project, abbreviated as "Hautbois". The initial aim was to create a classical music simulator from text-based scripts. With the growth of this project, new features may be added that extends the system beyond simply a simulator.
