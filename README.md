# Hautbois

### The Hautbois Project

The "**H**ybrid **a**nd **U**niversal **T**ext-**B**ased **O**rchestral **I**nstruments **S**imulator" project, abbreviated as "Hautbois". The initial aim was to create a classical music simulator from text-based scripts. However, this project has grown with time, the features extended beyond a simple simulator, but more of a versatile system.
