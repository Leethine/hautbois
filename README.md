### _The Music simulator in your Chamber_

### The Hautbois Project

The "**H**ybrid **a**nd **U**niversal **T**ext-**B**ased **O**rchestral **I**nstruments **S**imulator" peoject, aka Hautbois, as the name indicates, aimes to create a text-based simulator for instruments, especially those in Baroque period.

### Components

Like in the real world, the program consists of several components:
 - Composer
    Composers use to write on parchment with a quill, but now with computer, they can write in [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/ "LilyPond Priject").
 - Conductor
    The "conductor" of the program, like their role in the real world, is to interpretate the composition into definition of music sequences. They then instruct the players to play the music sequence according to their interpretation.
 - Instrument player
    In the real world, the instrument player tries (maybe) to understand the conductors interpretation, and play out the music sounds. In the program, the "instrument player" is the sound sequence generator, who generate the sound sequence according to (for sure) the instruction from the "conductor".
